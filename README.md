# CMOS Imager Design Project

This was my final project for Intro to VLSI at Johns Hopkins. We designed a CMOS active pixel sensor (APS) from the
schematic to layout using Cadence. The goal was to build a compact, high-resolution imager on a 2.5mm x 2.5mm chip.

The report covers:
- 3T-APS pixel schematic and layout
- 4x4 test array with shift registers and buffers
- Final 248x248 pixel array layout
- Simulations, DRC/LVS checks, and methods to reduce fixed pattern noise

Made with Rocia Prass and Caroline Zhao. We each contributed equally to the design and write-up.
